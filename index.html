    ><strong>ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Following registration, you can review and change the information you
    submitted at the stage of registration, except Email ID and mobile number.
    An option for facilitating such change shall be present on the Application
    and such change shall be facilitated by the User. If you change any
    information, we may or may not keep track of your old information. We will
    not retain in our files information you have requested to remove for certain
    circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and
    enforce our terms and conditions. Such prior information shall be completely
    removed from our databases, including stored ‘back up’ systems. If you
    believe that any information, we are holding on to you is incorrect or
    incomplete, or to remove your profile so that others cannot view it, the
    User needs to remediate, and promptly correct any such incorrect
    information.

  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
  <p>
    We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
    unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect
    such data from unauthorized access by members inside and outside the Firm.
    We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal
    Information submitted to us and information that we have accessed.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is
    impenetrable. Our Firm cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor
    can we guarantee that information you provide won’t be intercepted while
    being transmitted to the Firm over the Internet.
  </p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
